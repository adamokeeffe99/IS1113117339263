        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Software as a service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software",and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft.
        SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software, DBMS software, management software, CAD software, development software, gamification, virtualization,accounting, collaboration, customer relationship management, Management Information Systems, enterprise resource planning,invoicing, human resource management, talent acquisition, learning management systems, content management , and service desk management.
        SaaS has been incorporated into the strategy of nearly all leading enterprise software companies.

       <h3 style="font-family:arial;"><a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/?origin=c9io">Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Cloud 9</a></h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Platform as a Service (PaaS) or application platform as a Service (aPaaS) or platform base service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
        PaaS can be delivered in three ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system, middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the consumer's application; as a private service (software or appliance) inside the firewall; or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.

       <h3 style="font-family:arial;"><a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Amazon</a></h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.
        A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware.
        Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers.

       <h3 style="font-family:arial;"><a href = "https://www.google.com/gmail/about/#">Communication as a Service (CaaS) - Gmail</a></h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices.
        CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS)

An example od CaaS is Google's Gmail . 

CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not wasted. There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement
